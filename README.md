# CreditCardOCR
Recognizes the card number on an image of a credit card.

Still in the early stages of development, with the program currently only having the ability to read text on a card at a basic level.

TODO:
Have the ability to take an image of a card and alight it so the card is perfectly centered no matter what angle the picture of the card was taken at.
Improve accuracy with recognizing characters.

All code under the MIT Licence.
